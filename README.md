Dependencies
------------
SharpBlade Library (included): https://github.com/Sharparam/SharpBlade
------------------
SharpBlade is a C# wrapper/implementation for the SwitchBlade UI API.  It's built using the SwitchBlade UI SDK from Razer.
Midi dot Net Library (included): https://code.google.com/p/midi-dot-net/
------------------
This .NET library provides convenient, threadsafe access to MIDI devices. It does this by binding to the Win32 API with P/Invoke and then wrapping that in an object-oriented API which feels right at home in C# / .NET.
